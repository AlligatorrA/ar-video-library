Now I've never been the one to play it safe
I might play a little dirty some day
I'm just following fate they say I'm the chosen one
I know what it takes to be the king
Be the song everybody wanna sing Bring harmony and be the chosen one
Aint nothing gonna stop us,
Aint nothing gonna stop this fire
I was born to be making history Something greater something higher
Ain't nothing gonna stop this fire
It's plain reality I was born to be Something greater something higher
Ain't nothing gonna stop this fire
Ain't nothing gonna stop this this fire
Ain't nothing gonna stop this this fire
They told me I was never getting far
But those words couldn't take to heart
I know the day will come be the chosen one
I never had a safe place to hide Run to the end of the
tunnel to find Train or the shining sun and be the chosen one
Ain't nothing gonna stop this
Ain't nothing gonna stop this fire
I was born to be making history Something greater something higher
Ain't nothing gonna stop this fire
It's plain reality I was born to be Something greater something higher
Ain't nothing gonna stop this fire
Ain't nothing gonna stop this this fire
Ain't nothing gonna stop this this fire
I was born to be making history Something greater something higher
Ain't nothing gonna stop this fire
It's plain reality I was born to be Something greater something higher
Ain't nothing gonna stop this fire
I was born to be making history
Something greater something higher
Ain't nothing gonna stop this fire
It's plain reality I was born to be
Something greater something higher
Ain't nothing gonna stop this fire
Oh ohh oh oh
This fire this fire burn burn burn
This fire this fire burn burn burn
Ohhh.burn burn burn ah.
Ain't nothing gonna stop this fire`,

In perhaps one of the most inspirational poems ever written, Kipling outlines for his son the behaviours and attitudes it takes to become a man, advising his son about how to perceive the world and life's challenges so that he can both learn from his experiences and resolutely overcome barriers.`,

'Tonight I Can Write the Saddest Lines' is a heart-breaking poem written by the beloved Chilean Poet Pablo Neruda. 

In these verses Neruda describes how easy it is for him to write the “saddest lines” as he struggles to cope with the loss of his girlfriend after a break-up.

In the end, Neruda says that these lines serve as his last goodbye to his love.`,

My favorite poem, it's interesting to hear how he reads it and interprets it. I would've expected more pauses or seconds of reflection to recognize commas/punctuation within the poem, but he reads it pretty quickly. I guess that just leaves everyone to read it at their own pace/meter.`,

THANK YOU!!!!!! Not many people take note of that: "the passing had worn them about the same." The roads are the same, one is not preferred over the other. This poem is not about being an individual, as most assume.  Most people just skip to the last few lines because they are the lines that are the easiest to comprehend.`,

Full Poem:
Did you tackle that trouble that came your way
With a resolute heart and cheerful?
Or hide your face from the light of day
With a craven soul and fearful?

Oh, a trouble's a ton, or a trouble's an ounce,
Or a trouble is what you make it,
And it isn't the fact that you're hurt that counts,
But only how did you take it?

You are beaten to earth? Well, well, what's that!
Come up with a smiling face.
It's nothing against you to fall down flat, 
But to lie there-that's disgrace.

The harder you're thrown, why the higher you bounce
Be proud of your blackened eye!
It isn't the fact that you're licked that counts;
It's how did you fight-and why?

And though you be done to the death, what then?
If you battled the best you could,
If you played your part in the world of men,
Why, the Critic will call it good.

Death comes with a crawl, or comes with a pounce,
And whether he's slow or spry,
It isn't the fact that you're dead that counts,
But only how did you die?

- Edmund Vance Cooke`,

Upon arrival in Japan, the Arashikage teach Snake Eyes the ways of the ninja warrior while also providing something he’s been longing for: a home. But, when secrets from his past are revealed, Snake Eyes’ honor and allegiance will be tested – even if that means losing the trust of those closest to him. Based on the iconic G.I.
